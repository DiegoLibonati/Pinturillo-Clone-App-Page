# Pinturillo-Clone-App-Page

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Join to the correct path of the clone
3. Go to the folder of my-app and run npm install
4. Go to the folder of server and run npm install
5. Run npm start in both folders or use docker-compose build and docker-compose up to run the image of docker (But the last of docker you need to run those commands in Pinturillo-Clone-App-Page)

## Description

I made a web application that will allow different users to enter different rooms using "Socket IO" (which allows us to handle sockets) to be able to play the iconic game pinturillo. This version of pinturillo was made from scratch, my version was called Dierillo. It should be noted that I didn't use code from anywhere else, it was pure improvisation. Users will be able to enter a room through a name or see which rooms are active through the page that is responsible for displaying which rooms have not started yet. After the owner of the lobby and/or room starts the game, the users will paint 1 by 1 during 3 rounds for 90 seconds the words they have to paint and the users that are not painting will have to guess the word and score points.

## Technologies used

## Libraries used
